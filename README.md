# Oxford 3000 

Welcome to the home repository of Oxford 3000, a very basic, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com)-based, quiz app.  
The app tests out your knowledge of 3000 most important words to learn in English, also known as [Oxford 3000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000). I took the definitions from the Merriam-Webster dictionary and thesaurus.

## How-to

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run:
    ```
    ruby main.rb
    ```
    This will start the Sinatra web server. The app will be availabe on http://127.0.0.1:4567
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:4567 and enjoy the quiz :blush:

A live example is available https://oxford3000.herokuapp.com.
