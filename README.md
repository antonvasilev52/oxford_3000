# Oxford 3000 

This is a simple [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com)-based quiz app, which checks definitions and synonyms of 3000 most important words to learn in English, also known as [Oxford 3000](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/oxford3000). I took the definitions from the Merriam-Webster dictionary and thesaurus.

## How-to

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run:
    ```
    ruby main.rb
    ```
    This will start the Sinatra web server. The app will be availabe on http://127.0.0.1:4567
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:4567 and enjoy the quiz :blush:
